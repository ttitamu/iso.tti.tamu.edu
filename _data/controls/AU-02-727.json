        "Description": "The organization:\na. Determines that the information system is capable of auditing the following events: [Assignment: organization-defined auditable events];\nb. Coordinates the security audit function with other organizational entities requiring audit-related information to enhance mutual support and to help guide the selection of auditable events;\nc. Provides a rationale for why the auditable events are deemed to be adequate to support after-the-fact investigations of security incidents; and\nd. Determines that the following events are to be audited within the information system: [Assignment: organization-defined audited events (the subset of the auditable events defined in AU-2 a.) along with the frequency of (or situation requiring) auditing for each identified event].", 
        "Example": "The organization monitors the use of information systems, maintains security related system logs, and retains logs in accordance with the organization\u2019s records retention schedules.",
