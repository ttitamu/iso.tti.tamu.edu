Verifying, as part of the initial authenticator distribution, the identity of the individual, group, role, or device receiving the authenticator;\nb. Establishing initial authenticator content for authenticators defined by the organization;\nc. Ensuring that authenticators have sufficient strength of mechanism for their intended use;\nd. Establishing and implementing administrative procedures for initial authenticator distribution, for lost/compromised or damaged authenticators, and for revoking authenticators;\ne. Changing default content of authenticators prior to information system installation;\nf. Establishing minimum and maximum lifetime restrictions and reuse conditions for authenticators;\ng. Changing/refreshing authenticators [Assignment: organization-defined time period by authenticator type];\nh. Protecting authenticator content from unauthorized disclosure and modification;\ni. Requiring individuals to take, and having devices implement, specific security safeguards to protect authenticators; and\nj. Changing authenticators for group/role accounts when membership to those accounts changes.",

        "Agency_Implementation": "<p>Passphrases are the primary authenticator mechanism in use within the Agency.  When new user identifiers are provisioned in an Agency information resource, the authorized official shall generate a random one-time passphrase that satisfies the Agency's minimum passphrase complexity requirements, and provide the new user's identifier and temporary passphrase to the sponsoring employee.  Mechanisms within the information resource that force a passphrase change on first login shall be used whenever available.  New user instructions shall include guidance to configure the two-factor authentication service for password self-service reset as soon as the user successfully logs in.  Passphrases with indications of being lost or compromised (e.g., appearing in a publicly-available user database dump), and passphrases that are discovered through routine auditing, shall be expired immediately and the user forced to change their passphrase on next login.</p>\n<p>Users shall be directed to self-service passphrase reset portals whenever possible.  In the event a user cannot perform a self-service reset, the user must contact the information resource administrator from their office phone (verified by the administrator using internal 5-digit caller ID) and provide identity verification such as UIN or other personal information.  The administrator may issue a random one-time passphrase that satisfies the Agency's minimum passphrase complexity requirements over the phone, send the one-time passphrase to a trusted third party, or require the user to appear in person to receive the one-time passphrase.</p>\n<p>Passphrase complexity and lifecycle standards for standard users shall adhere to the Center for Internet Security (CIS) benchmark, or the following, whichever is more stringent: minimum 8 characters, including a mix of upper-case, lower-case, and numbers or special characters; minimum 1 day between password changes; maximum 180 days between password changes; may not reuse previous 24 passwords.  Privileged users and service accounts adhere to the same standards, with the exception of a minimum 14 characters.  These standards shall be published at https://u.tti.tamu.edu/password-policy.</p>\n<p>Public key infrastructure authenticators (digital certificate private keys) are valid for no more than three (3) years from date of issue.</p>\n<p>Users are prohibited from sharing their authenticator with any other person.</p>\n<p>An information resource owner with responsibility for a group/role account shall ensure the authenticator is changed immediately upon revocation of a user's access to the group/role account.</p>",
