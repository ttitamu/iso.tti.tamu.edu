        "Description": "The organization:\na. Sanitizes [Assignment: organization-defined information system media] prior to disposal, release out of organizational control, or release for reuse using [Assignment: organization-defined sanitization techniques and procedures] in accordance with applicable federal and organizational standards and policies; and\nb. Employs sanitization mechanisms with the strength and integrity commensurate with the security category or classification of the information.", 
        "Example": "The organization  has implemented procedures to dispose of media containing departmental data in a manner that adequately protects the confidentiality of the data and renders it unrecoverable (e.g., as overwriting or modifying the electronic media to make it unreadable or indecipherable or otherwise physically destroying the electronic media), and in accordance with organizational records retention schedules.",

        "State_Implementation": "Prior to the sale or transfer of data processing equipment, to other than another Texas state agency or agent of the state, state agencies shall assess whether to remove data from any associated storage device. \nElectronic state records shall be destroyed in accordance with \u00a7441.185, Government Code. If the record retention period applicable for an electronic state record has not expired at the time the record is removed from data process equipment, the state agency shall retain a hard copy or other electronic copy of the record for the required retention period. \nIf it is possible that restricted personal information, confidential information, mission critical information, intellectual property, or licensed software is contained on the storage device, the storage device should be sanitized or the storage device should be removed and destroyed. Additional information on sanitization tools and methods of destruction (that comply with the Department of Defense 5220.22-M standard) are provided in the \u201cSale or Transfer of Computers and Software\u201d guidelines available at http://www.dir.texas.gov. \nState agencies shall keep a record/form (electronic or hard copy) documenting the removal and completion of the process with the following information: \n\u2022 date; \n\u2022 description of the item(s) and serial number(s); \n\u2022 inventory number(s); \n\u2022 the process and sanitization tools used to remove the data or method of destruction; and \n\u2022 the name and address of the organization the equipment was transferred to.",
