        "Agency_Implementation": "<p>The Rules of Behavior for Use of Agency Information Resources (TTI RoB) provides the rules that govern the appropriate use of all TTI-owned or maintained information resources for Agency users, including employees, contractors, and other system users.  The TTI RoB are issued under the authority of the TTI Information Resources Rule.<a name=\"_ftnref2\"></a>[1]  The prior TTI Acceptable Use Policy (TTI AUP) (dated November 7, 2013) is made obsolete by the publication of this updated version.</p> <p>All new users of Agency information resources must read the TTI RoB and acknowledge the conditions outlined in the RoB through the TAMUS TrainTraq application before accessing Agency data or other information, systems, and/or networks.  This acknowledgment must be completed annually thereafter.  By acknowledging these conditions users reaffirm their knowledge of, and agreement to adhere to, the TTI RoB.</p> <p>The TTI RoB cannot account for every possible situation.  Therefore, where the TTI RoB does not provide explicit guidance, users must exercise their best judgment to apply the principles set forth in the standards for ethical conduct to guide their actions.<a name=\"_ftnref3\"></a>[2]</p> <p>Non-compliance with the TTI RoB may be cause for disciplinary actions.  Depending on the severity of the violation and management discretion, consequences may include one or more of the following actions:</p> <ul> <li>Suspension of access privileges;</li> <li>Revocation of access to federal information, information systems, and/or facilities;</li> <li>Reprimand;</li> <li>Termination of employment;</li> <li>Removal or disbarment from work on federal contracts or projects;</li> <li>Monetary fines; and/or</li> <li>Criminal charges that may result in imprisonment.</li> </ul> <p>Supplemental rules of behavior may be created for specific <a name=\"_ftnref4\"></a>information resources[3] that require users to comply with rules beyond those contained in this document.  In such cases, users must also sign these supplemental rules of behavior prior to receiving access to these resources and must comply with ongoing requirements of each individual resource to retain access (such as re-acknowledging the resource-specific rules by signature each year).  Information resource owners must document any additional resource-specific rules of behavior and any recurring requirement to sign the respective acknowledgment in the security plan for their resources.  Each information resource owner must implement a process to obtain and retain the signed rules of behavior for such resources and must ensure that user access to such resource information is prohibited without a signed acknowledgment of resource-specific rules and a signed acknowledgment of the TTI RoB.</p> <p>National security systems, as defined by the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA)[4], must independently or collectively implement their own resource-specific rules.</p> <p>These TTI RoB apply to local, network, and remote use<a name=\"_ftnref5\"></a>[5] of Agency information (in both electronic and physical forms) and information resources by any individual.</p> <p>Users of Agency information and information resources must acknowledge the following statements:</p> <p>I assert my understanding that:</p> <ul> <li>Use of Agency information and information resources must comply with TAMUS policies and regulations, Agency rules, standards, procedures, and controls, and all applicable laws;</li> <li>Use for other than official assigned duties is subject to TAMUS policies regarding use of System resources[6];</li> <li>Unauthorized access to information or information resources is prohibited;

       </li> <li>Transport, transmit, e-mail, remotely access, or download sensitive information unless such action is explicitly permitted by the owner or custodian of such information and appropriate safeguards are in place per Agency policies concerning sensitive information;</li> <li>Use sensitive information for anything other than the purpose for which it has been authorized; </li> <li>Access information for unauthorized purposes;</li> <li>Use sensitive Agency information for private gain or to misrepresent myself or the Agency, or for any other unauthorized purpose;</li> <li>Store sensitive information in public folders or other insecure physical or electronic storage locations;</li> <li>Knowingly or willingly conceal, remove, mutilate, obliterate, falsify, or destroy information;</li> <li>Copy or distribute intellectual property including music, software, documentation, and other copyrighted materials without written permission or license from the copyright owner;</li> <li>Modify or install software without prior proper approval per Network & Information Systems procedures;</li> <li>Conduct official Agency business or transmit/store sensitive Agency information using non-authorized equipment or services;

and</li> <li>Posting Agency information to external newsgroups, social media and/or other types of third-party website applications, or other public forums without authority, including information which is at odds with Agency missions or positions.  This includes any use that could create the perception that the communication was made in my official capacity as a state government employee unless I have previously obtained appropriate Agency approval.</li> </ul> <p><strong>TTI Rules of Behavior Addendum for Privileged Access Users</strong></p> <p>The TTI Rules of Behavior for Privileged Access Users is an addendum to the TTI Rules of Behavior for Use of Information Resources (TTI RoB) and provides common rules on the appropriate use of all TTI information resources for all Agency Privileged Access Users,<a name=\"_ftnref18\"></a>[16] including Agency employees, interns, and contractors.  Privileged Access User account roles have elevated privileges above those in place for general user accounts regardless of account scope (e.g., both local and domain administrator accounts).  Potential compromise of Privileged Access User accounts carries a risk of substantial damage and therefore Privileged Access User accounts require additional safeguards.</p> <p>All Privileged Access Users of Agency information resources must read these standards and complete the accompanying acknowledgment in addition to the TTI RoB before accessing Agency information, information resources, and/or networks in a privileged access role.  The same acknowledgment process followed for the TTI RoB applies to Privileged Access User accounts.</p> <p>I understand that as a Privileged Access User, I must: </p> <ul> <li>Protect all Privileged Access User account passwords/passcodes/hardware authentication tokens;</li> <li>Comply with all system/network administrator responsibilities in accordance with NIS procedures;</li> <li>Use my Privileged Access for official administrative actions only;</li> <li>Notify system owners immediately when Privileged Access is no longer required; and</li> <li>Complete any specialized role-based security or privacy training as required before receiving Privileged Access.</li> </ul> <p>I understand that as a Privileged Access User, I must not:</p> <ul> <li>Share Privileged Access User account(s) or password(s)/passcode(s)/hardware authentication tokens;</li> <li>Install, modify, or remove any system hardware or software without system owner written approval;</li> <li>Remove or destroy system audit, security, event, or any other log data;</li> <li>Acquire, possess, trade, or use hardware or software tools that could be employed to evaluate, compromise, or bypass information resource security controls;</li> <li>Introduce unauthorized code, Trojan horse programs, malicious code, or viruses into Agency information resources or networks;</li> <li>Knowingly write, code, compile, store, transmit, or transfer malicious software code, to include viruses, logic bombs, worms, and macro viruses;</li> <li>Use Privileged Access (to include dedicated accounts or elevating processes to Privileged Access) for day-to-day work or communications;</li> <li>Elevate the privileges of any user without prior approval from the system owner;</li> <li>Use privileged access to circumvent Agency policies or security controls;</li> <li>Use a Privileged Access process or account for Web access; or</li> <li>Modify security settings on system hardware or software without the approval of a system administrator and/or a system owner.</li> </ul> <p>__________</p> <p>[1] <a href=\"https://tti.tamu.edu/rules/29-01-99-I1\">TTI Rule 29.01.99.I1, Information Resources</a>.</p> <p>[2] <a href=\"http://policies.tamus.edu/07-01.pdf\">TAMUS Policy 07.01, Ethics</a>.</p> <p>[3] <a href=\"http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/GV/htm/GV.2054.htm#2054.003\">Texas Government Code Â§2054.003(7)</a> defines an âinformation resourceâ as: âthe procedures, equipment, and software that are employed, designed, built, operated, and maintained to collect, record, process, store, retrieve, display, and transmit information, and associated personnel including consultants and contractors.â</p> <p>[4] Refer to <a href=\"http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title44-section3552&num=0&edition=prelim\">Title 44 US Code Â§3542(b)(2)(A)</a> for the definition of ânational security systems.â</p> <p>[5] Refer to the glossary of National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) <a href=\"http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-53r4.pdf\">Special Publication (SP) 800-53, Revision 4</a>, Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations for definitions of local, network, and remote access.</p> <p>[6] <a href=\"http://policies.tamus.edu/33-04.pdf\">TAMUS Policy 33.04, Use of System Resources</a>.</p> <p>[7] Agency information assets are defined as hardware, software, systems, services, and related technology assets used to execute work on behalf of TTI.
