        "Example": "The organization has controls in place to decrease risk of denial of service attacks (internal and external) on critical information systems. Examples could include use of tools and configuration settings at the network layer to combat such attempts, and/or proactively monitoring for denial of service attempts so timely steps can be taken to address the risk.",

Perimeter security controls may include some or all of the following components: DMZ, firewall, intrusion detection or prevention system, or router.",

Cloud-based mission critical information resources shall be served by redundant datacenters that provide continued access during degraded network connectivity at one datacenter.</p>",
